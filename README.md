# CSS GRID PROJECT

## this project was attempted on:

[frontendmentor](frontendmentor.io)

## what I learned in this project:

This project helped me to get a better understanding of how grid works.

### Key contents I got after covering this project:

#### Grid_Container:

a grid container is a a parent of grid items
it is where we add the [display: grid]() property

### Grit_item:

these are the children of the grid container

### Grid_track:

this is the distance between two consecutive rows or columns

### Grid_cell:

This is the area between two consecutive columns or rows

### Grid_line:

these are the lines that make up our grid.
they can be either vertical or horizontal
